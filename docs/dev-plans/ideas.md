# Ideas and far future

## Near future

**TODO.** Collect ideas here

### Divide functionality into separate modules

For example, create two main modules `fs` and `db`.

One semi-main module `fs-meta`.

And then there will be modules that dependent on `fs` or `db` module, or other user modules.

That's one of the reason for using node.js and npm, but I hope I can do it in Kotlin.

## Far far far future

I think it'll be cool to store metadata in blockchain (2018 - why not?)
