# Stage 1. MVP

## Development stack

At first I thought Node.js with Express.js is a good option (and I still think it's not bad) but I decided to use Kotlin as Kotlin can give **fun** and **joy**.

As it will be Kotlin, there will be some Java/Kotlin frameworks for web. I want to use reactive ones just because.

_Look at [this beautiful site](https://www.kotlinresources.com/) with Kotlin libraries._

Kotlin candidates for now:
- https://www.kotlinresources.com/library/ktor/
- https://www.kotlinresources.com/library/vertx-lang-kotlin/
- https://www.kotlinresources.com/library/hexagon/
- https://www.kotlinresources.com/library/kara/

_Btw, I liked Play Framework very much recently, but it is written in Scala, so I'm afraid it can't be used here._

It's the description of MVP, so it's possible to try several options for now.

## Basics

I see it all as the SPA app using server API's, so the frontend framework also need to be chosen, but I feel like it's far less important in MVP stage.

For the MVP stage there should be several API endpoints (which maybe can be accessed via Swagger)

**TODO.** Use Swagger to get SWAG

I don't know a lot about SPA and I think I should do a research about authentication in that apps. It's interesting, can I use plain old cookies for that?

## Development organization

GitHub has projects, I defenitely should give them a try.

Markdown files are good for now, are'nt they?
